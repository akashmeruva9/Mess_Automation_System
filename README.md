# Mess_Automation_System


Due to increase in number of students at universities in recent years, it is a huge problem for mess staff to differentiate between a Day scholar/Non-Campus person and hosteler, there were several methods implemented but none of them were properly successfully. With increasing students in universities it's tough to avoid the long queues in mess and also it's not possible for a hosteler to carry his/her mess cards & ID cards with him/her always
Using a Computer-Based Desktop App to verify the credentials of students while taking food in mess will lead in reducing the crowds and ease up the work for mess-staff as it is one of the objectives from our problem statement. It will be easy to differentiate between hostelers and day scholars as hostelers data will be already uploaded in the system.
